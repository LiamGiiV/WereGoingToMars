#We're Going To Mars! - v0.0.1.0

For the fine folks at Kinaxis.

Usage:

- sbt compile at `./` to compile.
- sbt run at `./` to run.
- sbt test at `./` to test. 

*Built and tested on a Windows machine which shouldn't matter, but Java's promise of being OS angnostic has yet to be realised and some of the OS file handling stuff can be pretty arcane.*
